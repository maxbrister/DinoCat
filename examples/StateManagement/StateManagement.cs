/// Simple "immutable" state management
/// 
/// Prior Art: Vanilla React
/// Pros: Simplest
/// Cons: Does more work on state change than Wpf
/// 
/// For effienct render/animations layout+rendering the framework needs to optimize layout/rendering/state
/// transfer anyways. On complex state updates DinoCat controls can skip any "diff" logic and just invalidate
/// layout+render. For native controls this may be less efficient.
/// 
/// Note: Common misconception is that the "entire" application will be invalidated every time state changes.
///       This is incorrect in practice. Each control (or component) should have its own state. Might
///       be difficult to message this/convince existing Wpf developers this approach is fine.

/// Same as simple "State", but don't track changes at the injection point.

/// Prior Art: ???
/// Pros: Minimal updates/minimal overhead (similar to Wpf bindings)
/// Cons: If you accidentally access state outside of "Bind" you won't react anymore.
/// 
/// Could be valuable for auto generated code. A markup compiler can figure out where
/// state is accessed and insert the nessisary bindings. Alternatively if users are
/// experiencing perf issues due to regular State behavior, they can switch to UnsafeState
/// and optimize that section of code by hand.

/// Eliminate accidental usage of UnsafeState by not providing access to the underlying Value.

/// Prior Art: ??? (It probably exists somewhere)
/// Pros: Just as efficient as UnsafeState but safe!
/// Cons: API is slightly less ergonimic than State or UnsafeState
/// 
/// This is an attempt at making "UnsafeState" safe. You can't access the state's value
/// unless you explicitly bind to it. It's possible to leak the value by abusing Set, but that sort
/// of abuse should be easy to catch in CR or with lints.
/// 
/// Catch: Since everything implements ToString you can accidentally use string interpolation
///        on the "state". There's no good way of protecting against this at compile time.
///        This could get confusing for new users.

/// <summary>
/// State can be access anywhere
/// 
/// Prior Art: Mobx, ☄
/// Pros: Leads to very clean example code with minimal updates.
/// Cons: Major additional complexity in the framework/user control external apis. Lambdas everywhere.
/// 
/// Works introducing "scopes" where change is managed/regenerated. These scopes are inserted when users
/// pass a lambda instead of an explicit value. Control implementors need to accept both regular values
/// and lambdas. They also need to wrap the lambdas.
/// 
/// Framework complexity: Biggest issue is we can't have implicit conversion from lambdas
///                       to user defined types. This means you need to have lambda/regular
///                       variants for everything that can be "bound" to. Additionally, there
///                       isn't a discriminating union type. This means we can't mix regular
///                       and lambda variants in a collection. C# 10 request??
/// Threading: C#'s threading model means you need to under (or maybe over?) estimate what needs to be bound
///            to in each scope. This is only and issue if apps are switching between threads while
///            generating multiple UI trees.
